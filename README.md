# TicTacToe

This is a console based implementation of an AI Tic Tac Toe Game.
It uses a Minmax algorithm to find out a counter move for every move made by the player.

However people can also play in two player mode.

One drawback this game has is, it requires the player to enter coordinates of their move.

It also makes extensive use of the Object Oriented Programming concepts such as:
    - Inheritance
    - Polymorphism
    - Encapsulation
    - Abstraction
